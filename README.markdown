Twix is a simple but opinionated JS library for working with date ranges, and includes a customizable smart formatter. It's written in CoffeeScript and it depends on [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).

It allows you to do, among other things, this:

```js
var t = moment("1982-01-25T09:30").twix("1982-01-25T13:30");

t.format();  //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM

t.isSame("day"); //=> true
t.humanizeLength(); //=> "4 hours"
t.count("days"); //=> 1
```

And much more.

##Building##

If you want to build Twix for yourself, you'll need to install CoffeeScript. Then clone the repo out and run this:

    make configure build

Configure just installs the NPMs and brings in Moment as a submodule, so you only have to do that part once.

Note that the source is `src/twix.coffee`; the output is `bin/twix.js`. You can run the tests via

    make test

You can also run the tests in-browser by building and then loading `test/test.html`.

##Contributing##

Patches are welcome!

 * Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch. I merge develop to master when we cut a release.
 * Don't include your changes to the generated `.js` files in the patch; they're much harder to merge. I'll generate them when I cut the release.

##Changelog##

 * **0.5.0**: Fix intersection/overlap behavior (#36), expand signature, and deal with Moment deprecations.

 * **0.4.0**: Simplified internationalization support (**possibly breaking change for those few people using French support**), added more complex iteration durations. Reverted build complexity.

 * **0.3.0**: AMD support, basic internationalization support, bug fix for `countInner` and `iterateInner`. Component and bower support. New build system and code organization.

 * **0.2.2**: Added `isValid` and `intersection`, fixed `overlaps` for adjacent times, renamed `merge` to `union`, added deprecation warnings.

 * **0.2.1**: Added `countInner`, `contains`, `iterateInner`, and `length`

 * **0.2.0**: Deprecated `sameDay`, `sameYear`, `countDays`, `daysIn`, `past`, and `duration`. Added `isSame`, `humanizeLength`, `asDuration`, `isPast`, `isFuture`, `isCurrent`. Added duration methods. Emphasized moment() monkey patch methods over Twix() constructor. Some bug fixes.

 * Older versions - wasn't tracking.
