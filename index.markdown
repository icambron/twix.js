##<a id="gettingStarted"></a>Getting started

###Browser

Grab [the
file](https://raw.github.com/icambron/twix.js/master/bin/twix.min.js) as
well as
[moment.js](https://raw.github.com/timrwood/moment/2.0.0/moment.min.js).
Then simply reference twix after moment:

```html
<script src="moment.min.js"></script>
<script src="twix.min.js"></script>
```

###Node.js

To install, run

```
npm install twix
```

And then in your application, just `require` moment and twix.

```js
var moment = require('moment');
require('twix');
```

##<a id="creatingRanges"></a>Creating ranges

Twix mixes the `twix()` method into all moment objects. You use that to create a time range from that moment:

```js
var range = moment(startTime).twix(endTime); //=> from start time until end time
```

You can also create a range directly from the moment constructor:

```js
var range = moment.twix(startTime, endTime);
```

You can also create a range from a moment duration object. See [Creating a duration from a range](#rangeFromDuration).

###Inputs accepted

To specify the dates, you can pass in anything that can be processed by moment's one-argument constructor. This includes:

 * A JS Date object
 * A moment object
 * Anything parsable by the Date() constructor. This includes most obvious date formats.


If you want more complicated parsing, just use moment for that:

```js
var startTime = moment('2012 juillet', 'YYYY MMM', 'fr');
var endTime = moment('2012 August', 'YYYY MMM', 'en');
var range = moment.twix(startTime, endTime); //=> from July 1 to August 1
```

###All day ranges

Regular events last from a specific moment in time to another specific moment in time. All-day events, on the other hand, capture the concept of the entire day. It's an important distinction in several respects:

 * The ranges are actually different times. A regular event from 5/25 - 5/26 is from 5/25, 12:00 AM to 5/26, 12:00, where as the all day event is over both days.
 * All of Twix's functions respect the all-day semantics when comparing or
 * The time range is formatted to differently -- see [below](#formattingAllDay) for more information.

You create an all-day range by passing `true` as an extra argument to `twix()`:

```js
moment('5/25/1982').twix('5/26/1982', true);
```

##<a id="basicOperations"></a>Basic operations

###same()

Does the event begin and end on the same minute/hour/day/month/year? Any time period understood by moment will work.

```js
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/26/1982 6:00").same("day");  //=> false
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/25/1982 6:00").same("day");  //=> true
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/25/1982 6:00").same("year"); //=> true
```

###isPast()

Does the range end in the past?

```js
moment("5/25/1982").twix("5/26/1982").isPast(); //=> true
```

###isFuture()

Does the range start in the future?

```js
moment("5/25/2054").twix("5/26/2054").isFuture(); //=> true
```

###isCurrent()

Does the range include the current time?

```js
moment.subtract(1, "hour").twix(moment().add(1, "hour")).isCurrent(); //=> true
```

###contains()

Determine whether a range contains a time. You can pass in a moment object, a JS date, or a string parsable by the Date constructor. The range is considered inclusive of its endpoints.

```js
moment("5/25/1982").twix("5/28/1982").contains("5/26/1982"); //=> true
```

###<a id="length"></a>length()
Calculate the length of the range in terms of minutes/hours/days/months/etc. Any time period understood by moment will work.

```js
moment("5/25/1982 5:30").twix("5/25/1982 6:30").length("hours")  //=> 1
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/30/1982 6:00").count("days")    //=> 6
```

See also [asDuration()](#asDuration).

###<a id="count"></a>count()
The number of minutes/hours/days/months/years the range includes, even in part. Any time period understood by moment will work.

```js
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/25/1982 6:00").count("days")  //=> 1
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/26/1982 6:00").count("days")  //=> 2
```

Note that this is counting sections of the calendar, not periods of time. So it asks "what dates are included by this range?" as opposed to "how many 24-hour periods are contained in this range?" For the latter, see [length()](#length).

###<a id="countInner"></a>countInner()
The number of minutes/hours/days/months/years that are completely contained, such that both the beginning and end of the period fall inside the range. Any time period understood by moment will work.

```js
moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/25/1982 6:00").countInner("days")  //=> 0
moment("5/24/1982 5:00").twix("5/26/1982 6:00").countInner("days")  //=> 1
```

See also [count()](#count) and [length()](#length).

###<a id="iterate"></a>iterate()
Returns an iterator that will return each a moment for each time period included in the range. Any time period understood by moment will work.

```js
var iter = moment("5/25/1982 5:00").twix("5/26/1982 6:00").iterate("days");
iter.hasNext(); //=> false
iter.next(); //=> moment("5/25/1982")
iter.next(); //=> moment("5/26/1982")
iter.hasNext(); //=> false
iter.next(); //=> null
```

###iterateInner()
Like [iterate()](#iterate), but only for days completely contained in the range.

```js
var iter = moment("5/24/1982 5:00").twix("5/27/1982 6:00").iterateInner("days");
iter.hasNext(); //=> false
iter.next(); //=> moment("5/25/1982")
iter.next(); //=> moment("5/26/1982")
iter.hasNext(); //=> false
iter.next(); //=> null
```

##<a id="multipleRanges"></a>Working with multiple ranges

###overlaps()
Does this range overlap another range?

```js
var range1 = new Twix("5/25/1982", "5/30/1982");
var range2 = new Twix("5/27/1982", "6/13/1982");

range1.overlaps(range2); //=> true
```

###engulfs()
Does this range have a start time before and an end time after another range?

```js
var range1 = new Twix("5/25/1982", "8/30/1982");
var range2 = new Twix("5/27/1982", "6/13/1982");

range1.overlaps(range2); //=> true
range2.overlaps(range1); //=> false
```

###equals()
Are these two ranges the same? Equality also requires that either both or neither ranges are all-day.

```js
var range1 = new Twix("5/25/1982", "8/30/1982");
var range2 = new Twix("5/25/1982", "8/30/1982");

range1.equals(range2); //=> true
range2.equals(range1); //=> true
```

###merge()
Produce a range that has the minimum start time and the maximum end time of the two ranges.

```js
var range1 = new Twix("5/25/1982", "5/30/1982");
var range2 = new Twix("5/27/1982", "6/13/1982");

range1.merge(range2); //=> 5/25/82 - 6/13/1982
```

##<a id="momentDurations"></a>Working with Moment durations

Moment now has [durations](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/), which a block of time, but not a *specific* block of time, just a period of, say, hours or days. Twix provides some utilities for working with durations.

###<a id="rangeFromDuration"></a>Creating a range from a duration
You can create a range from a duration by anchoring it to a time:

```js
var d = moment.duration(2, "days");
var range = d.afterMoment("5/25/1982"); //=> 5/25/1982 - 5/27/1982
```

You can also make the range extend backward by the duration:

```js
var d = moment.duration(2, "days");
d.beforeMoment("5/25/1982"); //=> 5/23/1982 - 5/25/1982
```

###<a id="asDuration"></a>Creating a duration from a range
You can also create durations from ranges:

```js
var range = moment("5/25/1982").twix("5/28/1982");
range.asDuration("days"); //=> duration object with {days: 3}
```

See also [length()](#length).

##<a id="basicFormatting"></a>Basic formatting

While Twix's formatting options focus on [smart formatting](#smartFormatting), it also has a few other formatting methods.

###humanizeLength()
Get the length of a range in human-readable terms.

```js
var range = moment("5/25/1982 8:00").twix("5/25/1982 10:00");
range.humanizeLength(); //=> "2 hours"

range = moment("5/25/1982").twix("1/1/2013");
range.humanizeLength(); //=> 31 years
```

###simpleFormat()

Simple format produces a very simple string representation of the range. It's useful if you don't want all the cleverness of smart formatting. The signature is `simpleFormat(momentFormat, options)` and both args are optional. Here's how it works.

```js
var range = moment("5/25/1982 9:00").twix("5/25/1982 12:00");

range.simpleFormat(); //=> '1982-05-25T09:00:00-04:00 - 1982-05-25T12:00:00-04:00'
```

But you probably want to pass a Moment [formatting string](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). It will format both ends of the range accordingly:

```js
range.simpleFormat("ddd, hA"); //=> 'Tue, 9AM - Tue, 12PM'
```

All-day ranges will add some extra text:

```js
var range = moment("5/25/1982").twix("5/26/1982", true);

range.simpleFormat(); //=> '1982-05-25T00:00:00-04:00 - 1982-05-26T00:00:00-04:00 (all day)'
range.simpleFormat(YYYY-MM-DD); //=> '1982-05-25 - 1982-05-26 (all day)'
```

You can control that text through the options argument, and even get rid of it altogether:

```js
range.simpleFormat(null, {allDay: "-- all day! --"}); //=> '1982-05-25T00:00:00-04:00 - 1982-05-26T00:00:00-04:00 -- all day! --'

range.simpleFormat(null, {allDay: null}); //=> '1982-05-25T00:00:00-04:00 - 1982-05-26T00:00:00-04:00'
```

It appends some extra stuff 

##<a id="smartFormatting"></a>Smart formatting

The most important feature is formatting. By default, Twix tries to make brief, readable strings.

###The basics

Twix's `format` method returns a string showing the range. Called with no arguments it uses the default options for how to do that. The most important part of that is that it elides as much redundant information as it can. For example, if the event begins and ends today, it doesn't specify today's date twice. This makes for short, natural-looking time ranges.

```js
moment("1/25/1982 9:00 AM").twix("1/25/1982 11:00 AM").format();  //=> 'Jan 25, 1982, 9 - 11 AM'
moment("1/25/1982 9:00").twix("1/26/1982 13:00").format(); //=> 'Jan 25, 9 AM - Jan 26, 1 PM, 1982'
```

###<a id="formatAllDay"></a>All-day ranges

All day ranges won't show times: they're just assumed to take up the full day local time.

```js
moment("1/25/2012").twix("1/25/2012", true).format();   //=> Jan 25
moment("1/25/1982").twix("1/25/1982", true).format();   //=> Jan 25, 1982
moment("1/25/2012").twix("1/26/2012", true).format();   //=> Jan 25 - 26
moment("1/25/1982").twix("2/25/1982", true).format();   //=> Jan 25 - Feb 25, 1982
moment("1/25/1982").twix(new Date(), true).format();    //=> Jan 25, 1982 - Jan 9, 2012
```

Notice the various the different kinds of groupings and abbreviations:

 * If the entire range occurs within the current year, Twix doesn't show the year.
 * Twix only shows the year and month once if they're consistent across the range.
 * If it's all the same day, Twix doesn't show a range at all.

###Ranges with hours and minutes

Unless the allDay parameter is set to true, the time is considered relevant:

```js
moment("1/25/1982 9:30 AM").twix("1/25/1982 1:30 PM").format();  //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM
moment("1/25/1982 9:30 AM").twix(new Date()).format();           //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - Jan 9, 2012, 3:05 AM
moment("1/25/1982").twix("1/27/1982").format();                  //=> Jan 25, 12 AM - Jan 27, 12 AM, 1982
```

### Brevity and its discontents

Twix chops off the `:00` on whole hours and, where possible, only display AM/PM once. This can be turned off:

```js
var twix = moment("5/25/2012 9:00").twix("5/25/2012 10:00");

twix.format();                                                    //=> May 25, 9 - 10 AM
twix.format({implicitMinutes: false, groupMeridiems: false});     //=> May 25, 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
```

There's an `implicitYear` option, which you can use to always show the year, even when it's this year:

```js
var twix = moment().twix(moment().add('days', 1));
twix.format({implicitYear: false}); //=> Mar 28, 1:13 AM - Mar 29, 1:13 AM, 2013
```

### 24-hour time

Right, not everyone is American:

```js
moment("5/25/2012 16:00").twix("5/25/2012 17:00").format({twentyFourHour: true});
//=> May 25, 16:00 - 17:00
```

Notice there's no hour abbreviation.

### Changing the format

I've made the format hackable, allowing you to specify the Moment formatting parameters externally -- these are what Twix uses to format the bits and pieces of text it glues together. You can use that to adjust how, say, months are displayed:

```js
moment("1/25/2012 8:00").twix("1/25/2012 17:00").format({
  monthFormat: "MMMM",
  dayFormat: "Do"
});                                                   //=> January 25th, 8 AM - 5 PM
```

See all the `*Format` options below. You should look at [Moment's format documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) for more info. YMMV -- because of the string munging, not everything will act quite like you expect.

### Odds and ends

You can get rid of the space before the meridiem:

```js
moment("5/25/2012 8:00").twix("5/25/2012 17:00").format({spaceBeforeMeridiem: false});
//=> May 25, 8AM - 5PM
```

If you're showing the date somewhere else, it's sometimes useful to only show the times:

```js
moment("5/25/2012 8:00").twix("5/25/2012 17:00").format({showDate: false}); //=> 8 AM - 5 PM
```

This doesn't affect ranges that span multiple days; they still show the dates.

If you combine an all-day event with `showDate:false`, you get this:

```js
moment("1/25/2012").twix("1/25/2012", true).format({showDate: false}); //=> All day
```

That text is customizable through the `allDay` option.

### All the options

Here are all the options and their defaults

```js
{
  groupMeridiems: true,
  spaceBeforeMeridiem: true,
  showDate: true,
  showDayOfWeek: false,
  twentyFourHour: false,
  implicitMinutes: true,
  implicitYear: true,
  yearFormat: "YYYY",
  monthFormat: "MMM",
  weekdayFormat: "ddd",
  dayFormat: "D",
  meridiemFormat: "A",
  hourFormat: "h",
  minuteFormat: "mm",
  allDay: "all day",
  explicitAllDay: false,
  lastNightEndsAt: 0
}
```
